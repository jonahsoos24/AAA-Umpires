# Changes In Minor League Umpire Tendencies With The Challenge and Automatic Ball-Strikes Systems

Presented at SABR 2024 Conference
- Analyzed Umpire tendencies in the ABS and Challenge Systems
- Used the 2023 AAA season as the focus -- first-time minors used both systems interchangeably for a full season
- Used an XGBoost Model with Bootstrapping for standard errors to predict umpire inaccuracy
- Found Umpires improved all around under surveillance, especially in 3-2 counts, and that they shrunk an overexpanded strike zone.
